**Floyds Algorithm** - Iterative and Recursive

**Introduction/Background** 

This repository contains a various python codes utilising Floyds Algorithm. Floydâ€™s algorithm is a shortest path algorithm that identifies the shortest path between two
nodes on a graph.

**Directory and diagram structure**

**Installation instructions user**

This is a basic set of modules, the user should use the version v2 for the recursive algorithm and the imperative iterative file to run floyds algorithm either recursively or iteratively. They
can simply copy the code along with the Graph_Data module and run the code. Once installed the user can feel free to amend the graph data to investiagte different graph data sets. 

This file contains performance and unit testing.

There is also a copied code from Geeks for geeks for floyd algrothim which i have ran a performance test on to compare to the speed of my written code. 

**Known Issues (work in progress)**

None identified at the moment, i would welcome any suggestions on how to improve the code.
